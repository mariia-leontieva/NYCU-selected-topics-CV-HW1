StudentID: 313540002<br>
Name: Leontieva Mariia, 馬莉亞<br>

### Introduction

In this assignment, we train a ResNet network (in my case - ResNet50) to perform classification on [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fx4Z6xl5b6r4UFkBrn5l0oPEIagZxQ5u/view?usp=drive_link) with 100 classes.

## Results
Results without data augmentation:<br>

Learning curve after 20 epochs with LR = 0.0001<br>
